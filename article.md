# Defeating Distortion in Symbolic Coherence
*September 15, 2025*

> New in v5.6.0L-CKMM-D: Default summary mode, async safety, tiny real data with seed, config schemas, notebook previews, challenge hardening, multi‑GPU awareness. Public Disclosure Parity maintained at v5.4.4 detail. CKMM remains interfaces‑only and non‑sensitive.

## Penguin Problem & Distortion
Fractions: empty=1.0, exception=0.6, myth=0.7 → divergence=0.3 (1−0.7).

**Adjusted Distortion Score**: `(modal_fraction * diversity) / (1 + divergence)`
Toy: modal=0.33, diversity=2, divergence=0.3 → score≈0.508.

## CKMM‑L (Interfaces Only)
- **FuelLedger**: wall time, peak KiB, attention ticks, CPU%
- **ReplayStability**: repeat a callable, compute majority stability
- **CouncilRunner**: majority winner, agreement, drift
- **ConstraintEvaluator**: regex‑based penalties from YAML rules
- **SubstrateInfo**: platform/machine/python/hint
- **Pass**: fuel, stability, (weighted) council, ethics, substrate

Weighted council uses `agreement * 1.5` as a public‑safe illustration.

## Parity Appendix (already visible previously)
- Toy fractions and thresholds as above
- HSIL policy names
- SAT/UNSAT demo
- Heatmap script
- Default workload 5M (autoscale; cap 10M)
- AdaptiveRepair uses *only* public CKMM signals

## Roadmap
- Q4 2025: medical audit
- Q1 2026: neurosymbolic adapter
- Q2 2026: multimodal probe
- Q3 2026: bias toolkit
